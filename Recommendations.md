# Recommendations to Bellabeat

## Findings
Users tend to be more active near the weekends. Users also tend to decrease tracking as the month goes on. Users do not often use extra features, such as the sleep tracker or weight tracker.

## General Recommendations
    
  * Bellabeat could create events for those paying for the Bellabeat memberships which would encourage continued use of the product. These events should encourage users to be consistent with it's features.
  * Bellabeat should create ways to get user attention and remind them if they have been sedentary for too long, or have missed milestones.
  * Bellabeat could also target their users on the days that usage is low more often or create incentives to be active on those days
  * Stakeholders should also revisit their sleep and weight tracker to find out why users do not engage with those features.

## Marketing Recommendations
  * Milestones based on user's stats could be added to "gameify" usage.
  * Marketing should be focused on the features that users engage in, tracking steps and daily activity.
  * Lessen marketing the sleep and weightloss feature until it is determined why users do not engage in these features as often.

## Summary
Bellabeat should continue to market their activity features. Place emphasize on Ivy and Leaf's ability to track and compete with Fitbit, but with a focus on women's health.
